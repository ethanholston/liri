Liri is a node.js application to retrieve information on concerts, songs and movies.

Concert search will search on the artist name and should follow the format of 'node liri.js concert-this "ARTIST_NAME"' 

Movie search will search on the movie title and should follow the format of 'node liri.js movie-this "MOVIE_TITLE"'. If no title is given, the results for Mr. Nobody will be displayed.

Song search will search on the song title and should follow the format of 'node liri.js spotify-this-song "SONG_TITLE"'. If no title is given, the results for The Sign by Ace of Base will be displayed.

The search command 'node liri.js do-what-it-says' will search based off the comma-separated text in random.txt. 

Screenshots of each search function and results can be found in the images folder.
